# ImageToBinary
The project "ImageToBinary" involves the process of converting an image into its binary representation, and then converting that binary data back into an image.

To achieve this, the project would first require an image processing module that can read and Extract image data. This module can then convert the image into a matrix of binary numbers using techniques such as thresholding, where each pixel value is compared to a certain threshold value and then converted to either 0 or 1 based on this comparison.

Once the image is converted into a matrix of binary numbers, the project can proceed to convert this binary data back into an image. This process would require the inverse operation of thresholding, where the binary data is converted back into pixel values based on a predefined threshold value.

The resulting binary image can then be displayed or saved to a file in a suitable format. This project has various potential applications, such as image compression, encryption, and transmission. It can also be used in various fields such as robotics, computer vision, and machine learning
